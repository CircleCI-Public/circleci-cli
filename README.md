## Getting Started

### Upgrade from existing CLI

If you installed the old CLI before, and you're on version less than `0.1.6`, you need to run the following commands:

```
circleci update
circleci switch
```

This command may prompt you for `sudo` if your user doesn't have write permissions to the install directory, `/usr/local/bin`.

### From Scratch

If you're installing the new `circleci` CLI for the first time, run the following command:

```
bash -c "$(curl -fSl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-cli/master/install.sh)"
```

This will install the CLI into the `/usr/local/bin` directory.

If you do not have write permissions to `/usr/local/bin`, you may need to run the above command with `sudo`.

## Configure the CLI

You may first need to generate a CircleCI API Token from the [Personal API Token tab](https://circleci.com/account/api).

```
$ circleci setup
```

If you are using this tool on `circleci.com`. accept the provided default `CircleCI Host`.

Server users will have to change the default value to your custom address (i.e. `circleci.my-org.com`).

**Note**: Server does not yet support config processing and orbs, you will only be able to use `circleci local execute` (previously `circleci build`) for now.


## Validate A Build Config

To ensure that the tool is installed, you can use it to validate a build config file.

```
$ circleci config validate
Config file at .circleci/config.yml is valid
```

## Contributing

Development instructions for the CircleCI CLI can be found in [HACKING.md](HACKING.md).
